# Voronoi-Fortune
Fortune's algorithm described in coq

## Overview 
Fortune's algorithm is a sweep line algorithm to construct the Voronoi diagram of a set of points in the plane. *In this task*, we wish to develop  **a formal description of Voronoi diagrams and of the algorithm proposed by Steven Fortune in 1986,** in the context of the [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) system and the [mathematical components library](http://math-comp.github.io/math-comp/). If time allows, we also wish to study how executable algorithms can be derived from the formal description.
