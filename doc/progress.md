	* I started reading the implementation mentioned in [here](http://blog.ivank.net/fortunes-algorithm-and-implementation.html). However, there are some cases there are not covered in the implementation. For instance, when a new site is introduced and the perpendicular line intersects two arcs (i.e. break points) is not mentioned. It seems the distance function is always assumed to be the Euclidean one, it's not clear what will break if it was another distance function ( Probably, it will make ordering points more difficult)  .
