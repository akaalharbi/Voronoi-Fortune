## Goals
1. Learn about the problem of Voronoi diagrams and Fortune's algorithm.
2. Write a prototype for this algorithm in Coq's programming language.
3. Write a specification for this algorithm in Coq's logical language.
4. Perform a proof showing that this algorithm satisfies this specification.

## Implementing the algorithm in Coq
`Deadline:` **23:59, 14th-April** . 

1. **Tuesday 9-April**   : Main goal, redesign the data structure. Bonus, add notations. 
2. **Wednesday** : Main goal, handle_site_event. Bonus, decompose circumcenter definition.
3. **Thursday**  : Main goal, handle_circle_event. Bonus, debug!
4. **Friday**    : Main goal, debugging. Bonus, think about the basic facts.
5. **Weekend**   : Leftover from above.
