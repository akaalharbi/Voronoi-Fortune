## Goals
1. Learn about the problem of Voronoi diagrams and Fortune's algorithm.
2. Write a prototype for this algorithm in Coq's programming language.
3. Write a specification for this algorithm in Coq's logical language.
4. Perform a proof showing that this algorithm satisfies this specification.
